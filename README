This is a python app which reaches out to the Reddit API and pulls in news stories, 
then reaches out to the individual news sites and pulls in metadata to display the 
stories in a nicer fashion.

Styling is at a minimum, but the functionality is there.

The app is basically just two scripts:
* app.py is a cron job that pulls in the URLs and loads the metadata into mongodb
* reader.py is the renderer for the news site


Uses:

flask
mongoengine
BeautifulSoup
praw (reddit python API)
